I believe that the right to be forgotten does interfere with the right to information. In the real-world things are forgotten, but that doesn’t come from people being forced to forget, it comes from time. Forcing google to “forget” something because it is bad or reflects unfairly on someone is too vague to ever be enforced in a positive and effective way. I think that we are on the right track with legislation, but the internet is a very international place, so we need international agreement in order to have enforceable and fair laws concerning anything on this scope.

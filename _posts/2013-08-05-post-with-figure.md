The article "The Computer for the 21st Century" was very interesting because it offered a historical perspective on computing, but the ideas in the article were nowhere near obsolete. I am really fascinated with the idea of a technology becoming so commonplace that it ceases to be something of wonder and starts to become an accepted part of human existance. Since this article was published I think we have seen a definite begining to this process. In my own personal life, my 85 year old grandma who could not use her phone 5 years ago now is able to facetime me (quite frequently). Technology is now so intuitive that most people can easily master the functions of their phone and computer. There is still work to be done, but computers have certainly become less and less of a special technology and more of a neccisity to exisit in a modern world.

Philosophy of Data Final
Colin Jones 

My project consists of the visualization of a representation of what actual times during the term people considered leaving, and if they provided an answer to why they considered leaving that is also included the visualization. I also wanted to compare Bennington’s transfer in and out rate to other schools of comparable size and style to us to see if our retention rate was as bad as many people have expressed concern about.

What I decided to do was to use data I collected through a survey I distributed to first term freshman that asked 4 questions

1)	Have you seriously considered leaving Bennington?
2)	If so, how many times approximately times?
3)	Around what time of the term did you most often contemplate leaving?
4)	(optional) Why did you consider leaving?

The reason I chose freshman was that I found through my research that 1 in 3 freshmen drop out of college nationally, making them the most likely to drop out. In 2016, 82 percent of freshman stayed at Bennington. For comparison, the national average was 71 percent, Bard College’s was 85 percent, Hampshire Colleges was 81 percent and Sarah Lawrence’s was also 85 percent. 

I then designed a calendar that had a tick mark for every time someone considered leaving, where the color corresponded to if they gave a reason for their consideration, and if they did, what the reason was. This visualization was important because it shows the change in the times of year students consider leaving is normal and not out of the realm of possibility for most of us to imagine. There was one response that I had to leave out because the individual specified that there was no set time they wanted to leave, that person had considered leaving more than 10 times. The key of the calendar is as follows: social scene/party culture-yellow, location- green, academics/courses-orange, stress/failure- light blue, size-grey, issues with student body- lavender, expenses- pink, homesick- brown, no reason provided- Black, Actually Leaving/all term-red, Red Star- would leave but unable to.

What I took from this project is that Bennington’s freshman transfer rate, in the case of Freshman, is actually above average. This is especially true when you factor in that 10 percent of the student body here transfers in from other schools. Also, it seems that most freshman considered leaving the most around emotionally and academically challenging periods of the term.

In the future, I would like to expand this in two ways. The first would be expanding research to more than freshman, as the numbers were limited, and also to expand more deeply into why students want to leave.

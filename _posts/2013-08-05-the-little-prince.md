 "I though the article we read this week made a lot of very interesting points about the reflection of our society in the data we collect, but I think it is a stretch to say that it reveals most of who we are. There are a lot of factors that are not considered in the article that would affect the meaning of the data, but it is still appalling to see how little the American people have actually grown in their ways of thinking. It led me to think about repression, specifically the possibility that maybe we have not matured at all as a society, we have merely learned to repress our thoughts, to not ask questions and therefore to never learn. But, you can never fully repress something of such magnitude, it will flare up. It is shown in the article when searches for racist jokes spike after something like the election of Obama, and in the real world, like the riots in Charlottesville. The more repressed the people the worse the flares will be. That is why it is important to express your confusion and concern in such confusing and polarizing issues such as race, gender and sexuality. Having an open forum for expression is so desperately needed, but the internet cannot be the forum, it is too fast, too open, and has no filter."
